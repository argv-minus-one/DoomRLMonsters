# DoomRL Arsenal

This is my take on Yholl's excellent [DoomRL Monsters](http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=37044) mod for [ZDoom](http://zdoom.org/). This version has a PK3-style folder structure (Git doesn't understand how to merge WAD entries). I've also added some gameplay tweaks.

This will probably be rendered obsolete whenever DoomRL Monsters 1.0 finally lands. Until then, though, there's this.
